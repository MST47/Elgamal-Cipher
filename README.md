# Elgamal-Cipher

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Elgamal Cipher in Python. The Elgamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography, which is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The implementation is divided into three main parts:
1. **Generation of Keys**: Create public and private keys.
2. **Encrypt Function**: Encrypt plaintext messages.
3. **Decrypt Function**: Decrypt ciphertext messages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the code, you need Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need the `Cryptodome` library which can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install Cryptodome
